# CoffeeSpot

Our first foray into making an app in Rails.

The brief:

> _Recreate the well-known restaurant review site 'Yelp' using Ruby on Rails_

My personal twist on this to keep the project interesting is to adapt the Yelp model slightly to review Coffee Houses instead of restaurants. I am particularly interested in introducing a different kind of review system for each venue:

* Cup Consistency - users are encouraged to quickly rate each cup for consistent quality, leading to a more accurate portrait of the service.

* Flavour Notes - I would also like to introduce this as a search item, so you can find venues that serve coffees that cater to your particular tastes.
